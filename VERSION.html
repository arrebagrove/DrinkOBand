        <h3>Drink O'Band Version History</h3>
		<h4>2016.10.16.0</h4>
        <p>Bugfix release.
        <h4>2016.10.13.0</h4>
        <p>Bugfixes for some crashes. Bugfixes for cloud sync. Sync did not work anymore because the authentication windows did not pop up.
        <h4>2016.10.10.0</h4>
        <p>Adding custom amount feature. You can now enter a custom amount when you select "Custom Amount" from the list of available amounts.
        <h4>2016.10.9.0</h4>
        <p>Another bugfix for the latest Insider Fast ring build. App was loading too slow and thus Windows terminated it after 20 seconds. This had to do with Cortana Voice Commands (This feature is still in development), which still is somehow broken in the latest Insider Preview.</p>
